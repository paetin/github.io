          <div class="post-content">
            <p>I have always romanticzed about becoming a writer. I love reading and it just seems like something that I would enjoy being good at. Crafting stories that are both entertaining and educational. Works with moral fiber that make people feel like becoming a better person when reading it.</p>
            <p>I feel very inept with writing. This is why its a perfect thing to work on. I like it, but yet it isn't really a strength. What gratidue one might feel from knowing that you weren't good at something and then becoming great at it. You just have to put in the time.. </p>

            <p>I am reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Clean/dp/1544507852/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=can%27t+hurt+me&qid=1600322389&sr=8-1">Can't Hurt Me</a> by David Goggins and one thing that he asks you to do is to try to work on things that are hard. Lead into the challenge. For me, I think that item is going to be leaning into learning how to be a developer. I've made progress, but I have hit a wall. I need to break through.</p>
            <p>I am making this website as a first step and will continue until I have mastered web development. I will manage and support my Remarkworthy site. Allowing me to improve my coding and writing at the same time</p>
